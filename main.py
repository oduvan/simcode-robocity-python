"""SimCode city controller — a MINIMAL starting point.

This starter does one thing on purpose: it keeps the robots alive and flies them
around to **explore the map**. It does NOT mine, build, haul, or climb Base levels —
that is for YOU to add.

Note: robots wear out two ways — running the battery to zero mid-flight (avoidable:
charge in time, handled below) AND simply flying too far. Every robot has a max
cumulative flight distance (its lifespan, `r.life_remaining` / `r.life_max`); once
it's flown that far it EXPIRES and is removed (`robot_expired`). This starter does
NOT replace expired robots, mine, process, repair, or level up the Base — growing and
replacing the fleet and running the whole economy (robot types, mining, the factory
tree, mechanic repairs, Base leveling) is YOUR job.

Read CLAUDE.md for the whole game (the goal, the buildings, the full SDK API) and
grow this controller from here. The idea is simple: `@on.idle` fires whenever a robot
needs its next order, so decide what the robot should do and issue one command.
